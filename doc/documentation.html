Fettuccine Webcam Aggregator
</title>

<h1>Fettuccine Documentation</h1>

<p>
Fettuccine is a "Webcam Aggregator"; that is, it allows you to quickly and
easily browse through a collection of your favorite webcam sites.
</p>

<p>
Fettuccine displays webcams one at a time.  Common image formats such
as jpeg, png, and gif are supported (including animated gifs).  Webcams
can be grouped into categories by giving them "tags".  Each webcam
image is updated at its own unique "refresh rate".  And, a link to the
home page of each webcam is made available.
</p>

<h2>Using Fettuccine</h2>

<p>
There are two sets of controls for Fettuccine; a few of the more common
controls will overlay the image at the edges of the screen, and the rest
are accessible from the app's menu.
</p>

<h3>Overlay Controls</h3>

<p>
There are just a handful of overlay controls:
</p>

<ul>
<dt><img src=":/icons/FetOpenUI.svg" height="48" width="48"> Open Controls</dt>
<dd>When Fettuccine starts up, this is the only visible control.  Pressing
this button will make the rest of the overlay controls visible, as well
as a label providing the name of the current webcam.</dd>
<dt><img src=":/icons/FetPrev.svg" height="48" width="48"> Previous Webcam</dt>
<dd>This control will switch the display to the previous webcam in the list.</dd>
<dt><img src=":/icons/FetNext.svg" height="48" width="48"> Next Webcam</dt>
<dd>This control will switch the display to the next webcam in the list.</dd>
<dt><img src=":/icons/FetTag.svg" height="48" width="48"> Filter Webcams</dt>
<dd>Pressing this button will bring up a dialog box with the current set of
available webcam categories.  Choosing one of the categories will cause any
webcams not associated with it to be filtered out of the list.  There is
also a "No Filtering" button, which if pressed will reset the list back to
the full set of webcams.</dd>
<dt><img src=":/icons/FetHome.svg" height="48" width="48"> Homepage</dt>
<dd>When pressed, this control will open the home page for the current
webcam in a new browser window.</dd>
<dt><img src=":/icons/FetCloseUI.svg" height="48" width="48"> Close Controls</dt>
<dd>This control will hide most of the overlay controls, leaving only the
Open Controls icon visible</dd>
</ul>

<h3>Menu Options</h3>

<p>
The current menu options are these:
</p>

<ul>
<dt>Select Webcam</dt>
<dd>This brings up a dialog box showing the names of the available webcams.
(If a category has been chosen, this list will only contain the names of
webcams which match that category.)  Pressing one of the names will bring
up the associated webcam on the display.</dd>
<dt>Filter by Category</dt>
<dd>This option brings up a dialog box with the current set of available
webcam categories.  Choosing one will filter any webcams not associated
with that category out of the full list.  Pressing the "No Filtering"
button will restore the full list.</dd>
<dt>Webcam Info</dt>
<dd>This option brings up a dialog box describing what Fettuccine knows
about the current webcam.  This includes the name, link URL, homepage URL,
and specified refresh rate.</dt>
<dt>Import Webcam List</dt>
<dd>This option allows the user to load in a new webcam XML file.  Note
that doing so will overwrite all the webcams currently installed in
Fettuccine!</dd>
<dt>Documentation</dt>
<dd>Selecting this option will bring up this file</dd>
<dt>About</dt>
<dd>Brings up a short description of this app.</dd>
</ul>

<h2>Using Fettuccine as a Widget</h2>

<p>
On the Nokia N900, you may also use Fettuccine as a widget.  To do this,
you can go to the N900's desktop manager by either tapping on an empty area
of the desktop and then pressing on the "gear" icon that drops down, or simply
by making a long press on the screen.  The "Desktop menu" option should now
be visible at the top of the screen.  Press this option, and then select "Add
Widget" in the drop-down menu that appears.  A list of all the available
widgets should appear; find "Fettuccine Widget" on that list and press it. The
Fettuccine widget should now show on the screen.
</p>

<p>
There are a number of options available for the widget, all of which can be
reached by pressing the "wrench" icon when the N900's desktop manager is
running.  When the wrench icon is pressed, a dialog box will pop up providing
many of the same options available when running Fettuccine as an app.  In
addition, it provides the ability to change the size of the widget, as well
as the ability to turn on or off several overlay controls.
